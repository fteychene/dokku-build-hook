## Usage

The plugin will search for scripts in application codebase to be executed on different phases of the build.

By default, the scripts should be installed in a `hooks` directory in the project codebase and be named as the corresponding hook you want to trigger.


Hooks :
 - [x] pre-build : This script will be executed before the build of the project (Buildpack or Dockerfile based)


### Configuration

The folder where scripts are loaded could be overrided by setting `HOOKS_DIR` configuration for application


## Example

Add a script `hooks/pre-build` in a dokku project.
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "Run something before dokku build the project"
```

When deploying you app to dokku you should see the following instructions before build
```

=====> End of pre-build script
```
